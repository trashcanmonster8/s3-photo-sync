# s3-photo-sync

My personal photo sync project

## Notes

### Process

This is just for fun and learning. Strict process isn't the main goal. But I plan to build the pipelines so that `main` -> deployed to "prod".

### Workflows

I want to leverage github actions and workflow to automate deployment of my project.

### IAC

I want to build the infrastructure almost completely in code.

### Reducer

Need to store reduced quality images so that I can view thumbnails without a larger overhead.
